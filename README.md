# Advancements in Occupant and Driver Monitoring: Leveraging AI/ML in Automotive Safety

##  Overview
# Call for Papers: International Workshop on Driver Monitoring Systems Using Machine Learning

In an era marked by rapid advancements in machine learning, sensor technology, information processing, and control systems, the domain of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) has witnessed significant progress. The nascent field of Automated Vehicle Safety(AVS) stands at the brink of deployment, offering a glimpse into the future of automated driving. As we edge closer to realizing high levels of automation in driving, particularly in the intricate web of urban environments, the need for innovative solutions to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency becomes paramount. Recognizing the symbiotic relationship in automated transport, and the myriad challenges that lie ahead, we are excited to announce the call for papers for the International Workshop on Driver Monitoring Systems Using Machine Learning.

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the potential of machine learning technologies and their application in driver monitoring systems to enhance the safety and efficiency of automated and semi-automated vehicles. As driver monitoring systems become increasingly crucial in the transition towards fully automated driving, this workshop provides a platform for researchers, industry professionals, and stakeholders to converge, share insights, and explore the latest developments in machine learning applications for driver monitoring.

## Topics of Interest
We invite submissions of original research papers, case studies, and review articles that address, but are not limited to, the following topics:
- Machine learning algorithms for driver behavior analysis and prediction
- Sensor technologies and data fusion for in-vehicle monitoring systems
- Real-time detection of driver distraction and fatigue
- Integration of driver monitoring systems with automated driving technologies
- Impact of driver monitoring on vehicle safety and traffic efficiency
- Ethical considerations and privacy concerns in driver monitoring
- Deployment challenges and solutions for driver monitoring systems 
- Case studies on the implementation and effectiveness of driver monitoring systems

## Industry discussion
The workshop will also feature an Industry talk, bringing together experts from AWS and Intel. This panel will facilitate a valuable exchange highlighting practical challenges and opportunities in the deployment of driver monitoring systems.

## Submission Guidelines
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers according to the guidelines provided on our website. Submissions should be original and not previously published or under consideration for publication elsewhere. Papers will be reviewed by a panel of experts in the field based on originality, technical and/or research content, relevance, and clarity.
